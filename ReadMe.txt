Build a new controller, new service, and add a method on TheMovieDbDispatcher to call out to "The Movie DB" Api (https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/movies/get-movie-alternative-titles) 
and retrieve movie alternative titles. We have created a similar one for television shows. You can use that as an example to follow to build this.

You can use your favorite api testing tool like postman or we have included swagger in this solution. To use Swagger launch the project and after the 
browser window loads type /swagger after it in the browser (http://localhost:52393/swagger). Your port may vary.  If your not familiar with swagger here is the 
documentation link: http://swagger.io/ but it will provide a way for you to see the existing api calls and documentation as well as test the calls 
in your browser window.
